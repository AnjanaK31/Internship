This is my first project as part of my internship at Unified Mentor.


Problem Statement:
XYZ company which was established a few years back is facing around a 15% attrition rate for
a couple of years. And it's majorly affecting the company in many aspects. In order to
understand why employees are leaving the company and reduce the attrition rate XYZ
company has approached an HR analytics consultancy for analyzing the data they have. You
are playing the HR analyst role in this project and building a dashboard which can help the
organization in making data-driven decisions.
