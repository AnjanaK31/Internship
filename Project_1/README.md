Employee Attrition Dashboard – Data Analysis Internship Project 


Problem Statement:
XYZ company which was established a few years back is facing around a 15% attrition rate for
a couple of years. And it's majorly affecting the company in many aspects. In order to
understand why employees are leaving the company and reduce the attrition rate XYZ
company has approached an HR analytics consultancy for analyzing the data they have. You
are playing the HR analyst role in this project and building a dashboard which can help the
organization in making data-driven decisions.

I'm excited to share my latest project regarding employee attrition at a sample company XYZ, developed during my Data Analysis Internship at Unified Mentor!

I created a comprehensive Employee Attrition Dashboard using Python, Dash, and Plotly. This project not only enhanced my data visualization and analysis skills but also highlighted the importance of data-driven decision-making in addressing employee retention issues.

Key Features:

1) Interactive Visualizations: The dashboard includes various interactive plots such as histograms, box plots, and heatmaps to visualize different aspects of employee attrition.
2) User-Friendly Interface: The layout is designed for ease of use, making it simple for HR teams to navigate through the data and insights.
3) Data-Driven Insights: Helps in identifying patterns and factors contributing to employee attrition, facilitating strategic decision-making.
4) Robust and Scalable: Built with a focus on clean, maintainable code and scalability for future enhancements.

This project was a fantastic opportunity to apply my analytical skills in a practical setting. I’m grateful to Unified Mentor for this learning experience!
